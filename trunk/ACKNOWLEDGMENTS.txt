ObjectiveFlickr: Acknowledgments

ObjectiveFlickr.framework incorporates CocoaCrytoHashing, an MD5 hash
wrapper developed by Denis Defreyne. Copyright (c) 2004-2005 Denis Defreyne.
The package is obtained from Andreas Meingast's site [1].

The class OFPOSTRequest is inspired by Ferdinand Svehla's code snippet [2]
which uses CFReadStream instead of NSURLConnection to perform better 
HTTP POST requests.

During the early stage of its development, Mathieu Tozer has given me many 
suggestions and shared great ideas. Thanks Mathieu!
