ObjectiveFlickr: Acknowledgments

ObjectiveFlickr.framework incorporates CocoaCrytoHashing, an MD5 hash
wrapper developed by Denis Defreyne.

The class OFPOSTRequest is inspired by Andreas Meingast's code snippet which uses
CFReadStream instead of NSURLConnection to perform better HTTP POST
requests.

During the early stage of its development, Mathieu Tozer has given me many 
suggestions and shared great ideas. Thanks Mathieu!
