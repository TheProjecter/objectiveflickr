<H1>OFFlickrContext</H1><hr>
 An OFFlickrContext object encapsulates API key and other
information required to make an Flickr API request. API endpoints
are also stored in the object. It also prepares URLs (such as getting
the photo URL from the photo information) for both ObjectiveFlickr
request objects and your own application.

<hr><br>
 Flickr API requires that applications pass at least an API key
when making any API call. Some Flickr methods require authentication,
which in turn requires two items of information, "shared secret" and
authentication token to be passed.
<br><br>
Creating an OFFlickrContext object is the very first thing that any
ObjectiveFlickr application should do. You will at least need to pass
the API key when creating the object. If you want to use methods that
require authentication, you'll also need to pass the "shared secret."
Later after you have obtained the authentication token, you can store
it in the object by invoking <tt>setAuthToken:</tt> method.
<br><br>
If you always use "high-level" ObjectiveFlickr request objects (i.e.
those of classes OFFlickrInvocation and OFFlickrUploader), creating
the OFFlickrContext object is perhaps one of the only two steps 
you need for the context creation. The other thing you'll need is
when later you have fetched a photo information block, you'll want
to call <tt>photoURLFromID:serverID:secret:size:type:</tt> or
<tt>photoURLFromDictionary:size:type:</tt> to get the photo's real
URL.
<br><br>
There are other URL preparation methods that are more "low-level"
but may still be of interest if you want to play with Flickr API
in depth.
<br><br>
To use a photo service that uses Flickr-compatible API endpoints,
simply call <tt>setEndPoints:</tt> and pass an NSDictionary object
with end point key-values stored within.
