CocoaCryptoHashing
==================

About
-----

_CocoaCryptoHashing_ is a very simple and lightweight collection of MD5/SHA1 functions for Cocoa (which sadly does not contain any of these by default). It provides two categories on both `NSString` and `NSData`. The header file is pretty well documented, so getting started should not be a problem.

Requirements
------------

You will need _Cocoa_ (and more specifically, _Foundation_), in order to use this. _OpenSSL_ is required as well, but since Mac OS X comes with it by default, this should not be a problem.

License
-------

_CocoaCryptoHashing_ is licensed under the _modified BSD license_. This license is included in every file, and is included explicitly in _COPYING_.
