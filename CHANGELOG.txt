ObjectiveFlickr: Change Log

2007-01-29:

* In sync with Flickr's latest photo URL scheme now

  Which means added support for "farm id" and the new "originalsecret"
  and "originalformat" data in the photo response block.
  
  Which in turn means -photoURLFromID:serverID:secret:size:type: and
  -photoURLFromDictionary:size:type: are deprecated. Use
  -photoURLFromDictionary:size: instead.
  
  For the Flickr additions, please refer to this framework's
  documentation and Flickr API document:
  
    http://flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html

* Added support for forming "buddy icon" URL

* Supports different Flickr API-compatible sites. You can "switch"
  API endpoints by calling OFFlickrContext's +setDefaultEndPointsByName:.
  23hq's endpoints (OF23HQEndPoints) seem to be more reliable whereas
  zooomr's (OFZooomrEndPoints) is not fully tested. My thanks
  to Tristan O'Tierney for having helped in shaping this feature.
  
* Unit tests for the framework. Currently testing only flickr.test.echo.
  This is a good start for test-driven framework development.

* Fixed a possible breakage caused by an unretained NSTimer instance.
  Thanks to Cam Stevenson for having pointed this out.
  
* The "forced auth" mode was not working. This is because NSArray
  and NSDictionary do not accept nil as contained objects/values.
  Please pass an [NSNull null] instead of nil if you want to make 
  a forced auth call. My thanks to Geoffrey Spear for having pointed
  this out.
  
* OFFlickrContext's +setDefaultContext: and +defaultContext can help
  you save time and cut redundant context creation (since in one
  app you probably only need one shared context instance). 
  Thanks to Olivier Destrebecq for contributing this part of the code.

* Changes in the demo code: now FlickrBasics uses flickr.photo.search
  instead of flickr.people.getPublicPhotos to fetch the user's photo
  list--including private ones.
  
* Changes in the demo code: ContactsBrowser adds "buddy icon view"
  that demos how to fetch the buddy icon of a contact
