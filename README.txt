ObjectiveFlickr: Read Me First

ObjectiveFlickr is a Flickr API framework that makes it easy to 
develop Flickr applications using Objective-C and Cocoa library.

This is an on-going project. There is still a lot of documentation
work to be done. Currently the only way to know how to use it is
by looking at the demos supplied here.

The project is itself hosted at Google Code:

Patches, feedback and comments are all welcome!
